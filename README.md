DriverPass Project Reflection
Project Summary

The DriverPass project focused on creating a secure, user-friendly system to help a driving school manage lesson scheduling, payments, and user communication. The client, DriverPass, wanted an online platform that would allow students to book lessons, instructors to manage availability, and administrators to oversee all operations. The system was designed to improve efficiency, reduce scheduling errors, and streamline communication between users.

The Business Requirements Document captured the client’s goals and user needs, while the System Design Document transformed those requirements into technical specifications, UML diagrams, and defined processes for implementation and maintenance (Pressman & Maxim, 2020).

What I Did Well

I effectively translated client requirements into clear system functions and use cases. My UML diagrams—particularly the activity and sequence diagrams—accurately modeled the workflow between users and services. I also applied user-centered design principles to ensure accessibility, aligning with the client’s need for a simple and intuitive interface (Shelly & Rosenblatt, 2019). Feedback from my instructor noted strong model clarity and consistent application of SDLC concepts.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one area, I would expand the Functional and Nonfunctional Requirements section of the Business Requirements Document. My professor’s feedback suggested including more technical depth, such as encryption methods, system authentication, and data security measures. To improve this, I would integrate clearer details about API connections, secure data handling, and response-time expectations supported by current software engineering standards (Sommerville, 2020).

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on convenience, efficiency, and data reliability. For instance, I designed scheduling workflows that reflect real-world driving-lesson coordination, ensuring users could book, cancel, and receive notifications easily. Considering user needs in system design is crucial because it ensures the final product solves the right problems and remains intuitive for end-users. A user-centered approach increases adoption and satisfaction while minimizing costly redesigns later (Pressman & Maxim, 2020).

Approach to Software Design

My design approach combines structured analysis with iterative refinement. I begin by gathering detailed requirements, creating visual models like use-case and activity diagrams, and validating them through peer or instructor feedback. In future projects, I plan to strengthen my use of modular architecture and Agile methods, promoting collaboration and adaptability during the design process. I will also place more emphasis on documentation so that other developers can understand and maintain the system effectively (Sommerville, 2020).
